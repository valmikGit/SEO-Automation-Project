# Search Engine Optimization

## Overview -
- This tool can be used for optimizing the result obtained by the scraping of a website.
- The tool is made interactive by providing a Graphical User Interface.
- The user can provide the URL of the website to be scraped, the list of words to be ignored and the list of words the user is interested in.
- The tool generates two plots: one which plots the frequency of each word the user is interested in and the other plots the frequency of the top 5 most frequent words on the provided URL.
- Also, an Excel sheet is generated which contains 2 parts: 1) The list of the words the user is interested in and their density and 2) The top 5 most frequent words and their density.
